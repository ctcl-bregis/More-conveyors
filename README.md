# Changes by @ctcl-bregis

## "Nerfed" and "Buffed"
Things that I have changed to balance gameplay

- Slowed the "Overclocked Drill" to half speed
- Removed some attributes from Composite Matter as an ammo type in the Foreshadow

## Distribution Blocks
Armored Routers are now actually faster along with any other "Armored" variant of a distribution block. Currently twice the speeed.

## Storage

- Added Surge Alloy Vault and Surge Alloy Container that are nine times the capacity as the vanilla counterparts and three times the capacity of the Thorium counterparts

## Power 

- Added Large Surge Alloy Battery and Surge Alloy Battery that are 10x the capacity of the vanilla counterpart and twice the capacity of the Thorium counterparts.

## Defense

- Changed sprites for the Composite Wall blocks
